Design project at the UNiversity of Illinois where the objective was to design a hexabot walker for a relief mission.
We designed and controlled a walker that can cross the bridge while carrying a water container. Check out the [design](https://github.com/harshg99/she_walks) and
the [report](/hgmain/assets/pdf/370_final_report.pdf).
