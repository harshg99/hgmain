This project started up as a fun project during my last summer break at National University of Singapore in 2019. It started out as a fun project
to design a autnomous vehicle that can climb up stair before we decided to pivot and build a rover. It started out with us three folks [Asyraf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asyrafabbas/?originalSubdomain=sg)
and [Ramu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vairavanramanathan/?originalSubdomain=sg) building a flagship oroject for SEDS chapter at NUS, until we got ambitious and started building a prototype
to raise money for the URC 2020 Rover Challenge during the summer. My responsibility in the project was mobility, and I help develop the controls and navigation software systems for the
prototype rover that was built under 600 SGD.

We were featured during the NUS Orientation Fair in 2019 through which we raised over 15000 SGD from university and industry
for the development of a rover at the University Rover Challenge in 2020.

I continued mentoring the team in an unofficial capacity after graduating in May 2020 and we were even featured in Channel News Asia.
