I am a robotics and Machine Learning enthusiast who is passionate about endowing robots and infrastructure with human like intelligence to plan and cooperate to complete tasks collectively.

I endeavor to answer three fundamental questions -
1) How should robots improve individual capability to complete simple tasks such as moving or picking objects?
2) How can we leverage a team of robots or infrastructure to collaboratively achieve a common team objective for instance collaborative assembly or traffic control?
3) What individual goals/skills are necessary to afford such a team to reliably complete tasks that need inter agent collaboration?

I draw inspiration from machine learning (with a special interest in reinforcement learning) and control theory to drive my research endeavors.
If I am not in the lab, you would find me either playing tennis or listening to AI podcasts.
