I am a robotics and Machine Learning enthusiast who is passionate about endowing robots with human like intelligence to plan and cooperate to complete tasks collectively. I was previously advised by Dr Guillaume Sartoretti and Dr. Ang Marcelo at the National University of Singapore, and Dr. Vijay Kumar at the University of Pennsylvania.

I work at the intersection of multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning and foundation models to drive my research endeavors.
If I am not in the lab, you would find me either playing tennis or listening to AI podcasts or playing my keyboard.
